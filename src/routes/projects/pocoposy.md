# PocoPosy - A PHP based e-commerce site

I began my work on PocoPosy in 2021 as part of my employment at SDL Technology. The site was built using PHP, and utilised the Laravel framework, with many frontend elements being built using vue.js.

I was responsible for integrating the existing project with new backend and admin features, as well as building out new frontend features and maintaining the existing codebase.

The live site is available at [pocoposy.com.au](https://www.pocoposy.com.au)
