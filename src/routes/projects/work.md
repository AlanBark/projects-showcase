# [INTELICS](https://intelics.com.au/)

I started my employment at INTELICS in May of 2023. This is my current place of employment.

# [SDL Technology](https://sdltechnology.com.au/)

I started my employment at SDL Technology in Janurary of 2021. I was hired as a Web Developer, but quickly branched out to take on a number of roles, including client communications, graphic design and handling deployments.

I have worked on a number of projects for SDL, including:

## [PocoPosy](https://pocoposy.com.au)

PocoPosy is one of the largest commercial florists in the greater Brisbane area. I was responsible for working with the owners to develop new features for their website, as well as maintaining the existing codebase. 

This project was written in PHP with Laravel, with components being written in Vue.js.

## [Queensland Academy of Technology Website and Education Portal](https://qat.qld.edu.au/)

Queensland Academy of Technology is a training organisation based in Brisbane. I was responsible for maintaining legacy website code, as well as developing new features for internal educational use. 

This included projects such as a moodle site with custom plugins, a login portal built on existing AD infrastructure, and development on a ticketing system for student support. 

## [Gabba Business Association](https://gabba.asn.au/)

I was tasked with building and deploying a new website and admin portal for the Gabba Business Association. I was responsible for the entire project, from initial design to deployment. 

This project was written in PHP and vanilla js, as requested by the client to keep things simple.

## Internal Projects

A large part of my role at SDL was to develop internal tools to assist with the day-to-day running of the business and other businesses. This included a number of projects, such as:

 - Custom CMS system for upgrading legacy PHP websites with a single code pass
 - PHP Library built on Laravel to assist with the creation of new websites, including features such as content management, handling file uploads, contact forms and general PHP improvements
 - Ticketing system and payment portal for all clients of SDL
 - Internal CRM & ERP system for managing clients, projects and billing

## Client Communications

Another aspect of my job was to meet with current and potential clients to assess what needs they had. 

I was responsible for scheduling meetings on site and online meetings, taking points from these meetings and transforming them into actionable, billable tasks.

## End of employment

In the second half of 2022, I left SDL Technology to focus on the final stretch of my studies. Working there was a great time, and being put into a position to take on so many different roles was a great learning experience.
