# Education and Achievements

## Queensland University of Technology

I graduated from QUT in Dec 2022 with a bachelors in IT, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Networks and Security, and achieved a GPA of 6.6. 

During my time here, I learned the fundamentals of software engineering and web technology, as well as gaining skills working in  and managing agile development teams.

### Capstone project

The highlight of this experience was the year long, real world capstone project, which I worked with Queensland Fire and Rescue for. 

I was the lead developer for a team working on an asset management system for QFES training assets. The project was built on an AWS backend, and utilisted Ionic, Capacitor and React to build out a hybrid web, mobile and desktop app.

I was responsible for setting up development environments, deciding the stack, configuring AWS and getting the skeleton of the project up and running, as I have had previous experience with the stack we were using.

## CleanTech Science Competition

During my final year of high school in 2018, myself and my friend, James Orman, placed in the top 10 teams globally for the CleanTech Science competition. This offered us the opportunity to travel to New York to present our project to a panel of judges, where we ultimately placed 4th.
